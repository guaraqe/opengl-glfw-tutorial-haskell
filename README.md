# OpenGL-GLFW Haskell Tutorial

This is a Haskell port of the tutorials in [opengl-tutorial](http://www.opengl-tutorial.org/).

The translation is almost literal and highly imperative, using [gl](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/gl) for OpenGL and [bindings-GLFW](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/bindings-GLFW) for GLFW. When arrays are needed, storable vectors from [vector](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/vector) are used.

Builds with GHC 8.0
